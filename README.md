# eXpOS
eXpOS, eXperimental Operating System, is a small operating system written from scratch for XSM, eXperimental String Machine, a hypothetical uniprocessor machine. eXpOS kernel for this machine is written in such a way that application programs can be loaded and executed by the kernel and also there are a few application programs, like the shell (for providing a user interface).
